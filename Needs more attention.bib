@article{Martinez-Valdes2016a,
abstract = {A new method is proposed for tracking individual motor units (MUs) across multiple experimental sessions on different days. The technique is based on a novel decomposition approach for high-density surface electromyography and was tested with two experimental studies for reliability and sensitivity. Experiment I (reliability): ten participants performed isometric knee extensions at 10, 30, 50 and 70{\%} of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force in three sessions, each separated by 1 week. Experiment II (sensitivity): seven participants performed 2 weeks of endurance training (cycling) and were tested pre–post intervention during isometric knee extensions at 10 and 30{\%} MVC. The reliability (Experiment I) and sensitivity (Experiment II) of the measured MU properties were compared for the MUs tracked across sessions, with respect to all MUs identified in each session. In Experiment I, on average 38.3{\%} and 40.1{\%} of the identified MUs could be tracked across two sessions (1 and 2 weeks apart), for the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis, respectively. Moreover, the properties of the tracked MUs were more reliable across sessions than those of the full set of identified MUs (intra-class correlation coefficients ranged between 0.63—0.99 and 0.39–0.95, respectively). In Experiment II, ∼40{\%} of the MUs could be tracked before and after the training intervention and training-induced changes in MU conduction velocity had an effect size of 2.1 (tracked MUs) and 1.5 (group of all identified motor units). These results show the possibility of monitoring MU properties longitudinally to document the effect of interventions or the progression of
neuromuscular disorders.},
annote = {This paper is more rigorous in the mathematics, and I did not undertand everything done here. However, it might be a good read for someone wanting to come back to motor-unit calculation},

@article{Carboni2016,
abstract = {The prototype of an electronic bi-directional interface between the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and a neuro-controlled hand prosthesis is presented. The system is composed of 2 integrated circuits: a standard CMOS device for neural recording and a HVCMOS device for neural stimulation. The integrated circuits have been realized in 2 different 0.35$\mu$ m CMOS processes available from ams. The complete system incorporates 8 channels each including the analog front-end, the A/D conversion, based on a sigma delta architecture and a programmable stimulation module implemented as a 5-bit current DAC; two voltage boosters supply the output stimulation stage with a programmable voltage scalable up to 17V. Successful in-vivo experiments with rats having a TIME electrode implanted in the sciatic nerve were carried out, showing the capability of recording neural signals in the tens of microvolts, with a global noise of 7$\mu$ V r m s , and to selectively elicit the tibial and plantar muscles using different active sites of the electrode.},
