abstract = {Objective: To assess the intra- and inter-session reliability of estimates of motor unit behavior and muscle fiber properties derived from high-density surface electromyography (HDEMG). Methods: Ten healthy subjects performed submaximal isometric knee extensions during three recording sessions (separate days) at 10{\%}, 30{\%}, 50{\%} and 70{\%} of their maximum voluntary effort. The discharge timings of motor units of the vastus lateralis and medialis muscles were automatically identified from HDEMG by a decomposition algorithm. We characterized the number of detected motor units, their discharge rates, the coefficient of variation of their inter-spike intervals (CoVisi), the action potential conduction velocity and peak-to-peak amplitude. Reliability was assessed for each motor unit characteristics by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Additionally, a pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) was calculated, to verify the accuracy of the decomposition. Results: Good to excellent reliability within and between sessions was found for all motor unit characteristics at all force levels (ICCs {\textgreater} 0.8), with the exception of CoVisi that presented poor reliability (ICC {\textless} 0.6). PNR was high and similar for both muscles with values ranging between 45.1 and 47.6 dB (accuracy {\textgreater} 95{\%}). Conclusion: Motor unit features can be assessed non-invasively and reliably within and across sessions over a wide range of force levels. Significance: These results suggest that it is possible to characterize motor units in longitudinal intervention studies.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for the control of robots, in position and force, using electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from muscles of the shoulder and elbow. A switching model is used for decoding muscular activity to both joint angles and force exerted from the human upper limb to the environment. The proposed method is able to estimate those variables in cases where no force is exerted to the environment (unconstrained motion), as well as in cases where motion is accompanied with force exertion (constrained motion). The switching model is trained to each subject, a procedure that takes only a few minutes, using a torque-controlled robot arm coupled with the human arm. After training, the system can decode position and force using only EMG signals recorded from 7 muscles. The system is tested in a orthosis-like scenario, in planar movements, through various experiments covering the cases aforementioned. The experimental results prove the system efficiency, making the proposed methodology a strong candidate for an EMG-based controller for robotic exoskeletons.},

This paper develops a method that can automate the process of generating and extending dictionaries and phrase tables. Our method can translate missing word and phrase entries by learning language structures based on large monolingual data and mapping between languages from small bilingual data. It uses distributed representation of words and learns a linear mapping between vector spaces of languages. Despite its simplicity, our method is surprisingly effective: we can achieve almost 90{\%} precision@5 for translation of words between English and Spanish. This method makes little assumption about the languages, so it can be used to extend and refine dictionaries and translation tables for any language pairs.},

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Exoskeletons for lower and upper extremities have been introduced in neurorehabilitation because they can guide the patient's limb following its anatomy, covering many degrees of freedom and most of its natural workspace, and allowing the control of the articular joints. The aims of this study were to evaluate the possible use of a novel exoskeleton, the Arm Light Exoskeleton (ALEx), for robot-aided neurorehabilitation and to investigate the effects of some rehabilitative strategies adopted in robot-assisted training. METHODS We studied movement execution and muscle activities of 16 upper limb muscles in six healthy subjects, focusing on end-effector and joint kinematics, muscle synergies, and spinal maps. The subjects performed three dimensional point-to-point reaching movements, without and with the exoskeleton in different assistive modalities and control strategies. RESULTS The results showed that ALEx supported the upper limb in all modalities and control strategies: it reduced the muscular activity of the shoulder's abductors and it increased the activity of the elbow flexors. The different assistive modalities favored kinematics and muscle coordination similar to natural movements, but the muscle activity during the movements assisted by the exoskeleton was reduced with respect to the movements actively performed by the subjects. Moreover, natural trajectories recorded from the movements actively performed by the subjects seemed to promote an activity of muscles and spinal circuitries more similar to the natural one. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary analysis on healthy subjects supported the use of ALEx for post-stroke upper limb robotic assisted rehabilitation, and it provided clues on the effects of different rehabilitative strategies on movement and muscle coordination.},

We show that combining EMG and pressure data sensed only at the wrist can support accurate classification of hand gestures. A pilot study with unintended EMG electrode pressure variability led to exploration of the approach in greater depth. The EMPress technique senses both finger movements and rotations around the wrist and forearm, covering a wide range of gestures, with an overall 10-fold cross validation classification accuracy of 96{\%}. We show that EMG is especially suited to sensing finger movements, that pressure is suited to sensing wrist and forearm rotations, and their combination is significantly more accurate for a range of gestures than either technique alone. The technique is well suited to existing wearable device forms such as smart watches that are already mounted on the wrist.},

abstract = {This paper contributes to clarifying the conditions under which electrode position for surface EMG detection is critical and leads to estimates of EMG variables that are different from those obtained in other nearby locations. Whereas a number of previous works outline the need to avoid the innervation zone (or the muscle belly), many authors place electrodes in the central part or bulge of the muscle of interest where the innervation zone is likely to be. Computer simulations are presented to explain the effect of the innervation zone on amplitude, frequency and conduction velocity estimates from the signal and the need to avoid placing electrodes near it. Experimental signals recorded from some superficial muscles of the limbs and trunk (abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis brevis, biceps, upper trapezius, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis) were processed providing support for the findings obtained from simulations. The use of multichannel techniques is recommended to estimate the location of the innervation zone and to properly choose the optimal position of the detection point(s) allowing meaningful estimates of EMG variables during movement analysis. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The human calf muscle generates 80{\%} of the mechanical work to walk throughout stance-phase, powered plantar flexion. Powered plantar flexion is not only important for walking energetics, but also to minimize the impact on the leading leg at heel-strike. For unilateral transtibial amputees, it has recently been shown that knee load on the leading, intact limb decreases as powered plantar flexion in the trailing prosthetic ankle increases. Not surprisingly, excessive loads on the leading, intact knee are believed to be causative of knee osteoarthritis, a leading secondary impairment in lower-extremity amputees. In this study, we hypothesize that a transtibial amputee can learn how to control a powered ankle-foot prosthesis using a volitional electromyographic (EMG) control to directly modulate ankle powered plantar flexion. We here present preliminary data, and find that an amputee participant is able to modulate toe-off angle, net ankle work and peak power across a broad range of walking speeds by volitionally modulating calf EMG activity. The modulation of these key gait parameters is shown to be comparable to the dynamical response of the same powered prosthesis controlled intrinsically (No EMG), suggesting that transtibial amputees can achieve an adequate level of powered plantar flexion controllability using direct volitional EMG control.},

abstract = {The discipline of human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) is concerned with the design of products, process, services, and work systems to assure their productive, safe and satisfying use by people. Physical ergonomics involves the design of working environments to fit human physical abilities. By understanding the constraints and capabilities of the human body and mind, we can design products, services and environments that are effective, reliable, safe and comfortable for everyday use. This book focuses on the advances in the physical HF/E, which are a critical aspect in the design of any human-centered technological system. The ideas and practical solutions described in the book are the outcome of dedicated research by academics and practitioners aiming to advance theory and practice in this dynamic and all-encompassing discipline.  A thorough understanding of the physical characteristics of a wide range of people is essential in the development of consumer products and systems. Human performance data serve as valuable information to designers and help ensure that the final products will fit the targeted population of end users. Mastering physical ergonomics and safety engineering concepts is fundamental to the creation of products and systems that people are able to use, avoidance of stresses, and minimization of the risk for accidents.     },

@article{AlHarrach2016,
abstract = {High Density Surface Electromyography (HD-sEMG) is a recent technique that overcomes the limi- tations of monopolar and bipolar sEMG recordings and enables the collection of physiological and topographical informations concerning muscle activation. However, HD-sEMG channels are usually contaminated by noise in an heterogeneous manner. The sources of noise are mainly power line interference (PLI), white Gaussian noise (WGN) and motion artifacts (MA). The spectral components of these disruptive signals overlap with the sEMG spectrum which makes classical filtering techniques non effective, especially during low contraction level recordings. In this study, we propose to denoise HD-sEMG recordings at 20{\%} of the Maximum Volun- tary Contraction (MVC) by using a second order blind source separation (BSS) technique; named Canonical Component Analysis (CCA). For this purpose, a specific and automatic canonical component selection, using noise ratio thresholding, and a channel selection procedure for the selective version (sCCA) are proposed. Results obtained from the application of the proposed methods (CCA and sCCA) on realistic simulated data, demonstrated the ability of the proposed approach to retrieve the original HD-sEMG signals, by suppressing the PLI and WGN components, with high accuracy (for five different simulated noise dispersions using the same anatomy). Afterwards, the proposed algorithms are employed to denoise experimental HD-sEMG signals from five healthy subjects during Biceps Brachii (BB) contractions following an isometric protocol. Obtained results showed that PLI and WGN components could be successfully removed, which enhances considerably the SNR of the channels with low SNR, and thereby increases the mean SNR value among the grid. Moreover, the MA component is often isolated on specific estimated sources but requires additional signal processing for a total removal. In addition, comparative study with Independent Component Analysis (ICA), CCA-Wavelet and CCA-Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) proved a higher efficiency of the presented method over existing denoising techniques and demonstrated pointless a second filtering stage for denoising HD-sEMG recordings at this contraction level.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been major interest in the exposure to physical therapy during rehabilitation. Several publications have demonstrated its usefulness in clinical/medical and human machine interface (HMI) applications. An automated system will guide the user to perform the training during rehabilitation independently. Advances in engineering have extended electromyography (EMG) beyond the traditional diagnostic applications to also include applications in diverse areas such as movement analysis. This paper gives an overview of the numerous methods available to recognize motion patterns of EMG signals for both isotonic and isometric contractions. Various signal analysis methods are compared by illustrating their applicability in real-time settings. This paper will be of interest to researchers who would like to select the most appropriate methodology in classifying motion patterns, especially during different types of contractions. For feature extraction, the probability density function (PDF) of EMG signals will be the main interest of this study. Following that, a brief explanation of the different methods for pre-processing, feature extraction and classifying EMG signals will be compared in terms of their performance. The crux of this paper is to review the most recent developments and research studies related to the issues mentioned above.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of using a factor model we call {\{}$\backslash$em spike-and-slab sparse coding{\}} (S3C) to learn features for a classification task. The S3C model resembles both the spike-and-slab RBM and sparse coding. Since exact inference in this model is intractable, we derive a structured variational inference procedure and employ a variational EM training algorithm. Prior work on approximate inference for this model has not prioritized the ability to exploit parallel architectures and scale to enormous problem sizes. We present an inference procedure appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent factors. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning capabilities of both sparse coding and the ssRBM on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We evaluate our approach's potential for semi-supervised learning on subsets of CIFAR-10. We demonstrate state-of-the art self-taught learning performance on the STL-10 dataset and use our method to win the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Challenges In Learning Hierarchical Models' Transfer Learning Challenge.},

abstract = {In this paper we present our results on using electromyographic (EMG) sensor arrays for finger gesture recognition. Sensing muscle activity allows to capture finger motion without placing sensors directly at the hand or fingers and thus may be used to build unobtrusive body-worn interfaces. We use an electrode array with 192 electrodes to record a high-density EMG of the upper forearm muscles. We present in detail a baseline system for gesture recognition on our dataset, using a naive Bayes classifier to discriminate the 27 gestures. We recorded 25 sessions from 5 subjects. We report an average accuracy of 90{\%} for the within-session scenario, showing the feasibility of the EMG approach to discriminate a large number of subtle gestures. We analyze the effect of the number of used electrodes on the recognition performance and show the benefit of using high numbers of electrodes. Cross-session recognition typically suffers from electrode position changes from session to session. We present two methods to estimate the electrode shift between sessions based on a small amount of calibration data and compare it to a baseline system with no shift compensation. The presented methods raise the accuracy from 59{\%} baseline accuracy to 75{\%} accuracy after shift compensation. The dataset is publicly available.},

abstract = {Myoelectric control offers a direct interface between human intent and various robotic applications through recorded muscle activity. Traditional control schemes realize this interface through direct mapping or pattern recognition techniques. The former approach provides reliable control at the expense of functionality, while the latter increases functionality at the expense of long-term reliability. An alternative approach, using concepts of motor learning, provides session-independent simultaneous control, but previously relied on consistent electrode placement over biomechanically independent muscles. This paper extends the functionality and practicality of the motor learning-based approach, using high-density electrode grids and muscle synergy-inspired decomposition to generate control inputs with reduced constraints on electrode placement. The method is demonstrated via real-time simultaneous and proportional control of a 4-DoF myoelectric interface over multiple days. Subjects showed learning trends consistent with typical motor skill learning without requiring any retraining or recalibration between sessions. Moreover, they adjusted to physical constraints of a robot arm after learning the control in a constraint-free virtual interface, demonstrating robust control as they performed precision tasks. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed man-machine interface as a viable alternative to conventional control schemes for myoelectric interfaces designed for long-term use.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to precisely predict muscle forces from surface electromyography (sEMG) for hand gesture recognition. A robust variant of genetic programming, namely Gene Expression Programming (GEP), is utilized to derive a new empirical model of handgrip sEMG–force relationship. A series of handgrip forces and corresponding sEMG signals were recorded from 6 healthy male subjects and during 4 levels of percentage of maximum voluntary contraction ({\%}MVC) in experiments. Using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons test, 10 features of the sEMG time domain were extracted from homogeneous subsets and used as input vectors. Subsequently, a handgrip force prediction model was developed based on GEP. In order to compare the performance of this model, other models based on a back propagation neural network and a support vector machine were trained using the same input vectors and data sets. The root mean square error and the correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted forces were calculated to assess the performance of the three models . The results show that the GEP model provide the highest accuracy and generalization capability among the studied models. It was concluded that the proposed GEP model is relatively short, simple and excellent for predicting handgrip forces based on sEMG signals.},

abstract = {Average Rectified Value (ARV) and Root Mean Square (RMS) are amplitude indicators commonly used in the field of EMG either in time or space. These two indicators are compared (a) analytically for a one dimensional sinusoid, sum of sinusoids, two dimensional sinusoids, and (b) numerically by simulating a high density detection system, sampling in space the distribution of propagating surface action potentials generated by a muscle motor unit (MU). For any signal sampled above the Nyquist frequency the estimated RMS does not depend on the sampling rate while the estimated ARV does. The surface potential is often sampled in space below the Nyquist frequency, by high density surface EMG detection systems (HDsEMG), generating aliasing in space. For point-like electrodes, the lowest spatial sampling frequency corresponding to the largest inter-electrode distance (IED), which avoids spatial aliasing for a simulated MU action potential, is 100 samples/m (IED=10mm). Therefore, IEDs below this value are recommended for measurements of EMG image features. From the theoretical point of view, the spatial RMS of sEMG images is more robust than the ARV with respect to the IED and should be preferred.},

abstract = {A new method is proposed for tracking individual motor units (MUs) across multiple experimental sessions on different days. The technique is based on a novel decomposition approach for high-density surface electromyography and was tested with two experimental studies for reliability and sensitivity. Experiment I (reliability): ten participants performed isometric knee extensions at 10, 30, 50 and 70{\%} of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force in three sessions, each separated by 1 week. Experiment II (sensitivity): seven participants performed 2 weeks of endurance training (cycling) and were tested pre–post intervention during isometric knee extensions at 10 and 30{\%} MVC. The reliability (Experiment I) and sensitivity (Experiment II) of the measured MU properties were compared for the MUs tracked across sessions, with respect to all MUs identified in each session. In Experiment I, on average 38.3{\%} and 40.1{\%} of the identified MUs could be tracked across two sessions (1 and 2 weeks apart), for the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis, respectively. Moreover, the properties of the tracked MUs were more reliable across sessions than those of the full set of identified MUs (intra-class correlation coefficients ranged between 0.63—0.99 and 0.39–0.95, respectively). In Experiment II, ∼40{\%} of the MUs could be tracked before and after the training intervention and training-induced changes in MU conduction velocity had an effect size of 2.1 (tracked MUs) and 1.5 (group of all identified motor units). These results show the possibility of monitoring MU properties longitudinally to document the effect of interventions or the progression of
neuromuscular disorders.},

abstract = {The selection of suitable peripheral nerve electrodes for biomedical applications implies a trade-off between invasiveness and selectivity. The optimal design should provide the highest selectivity for targeting a large number of nerve fascicles with the least invasiveness and potential damage to the nerve. The transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (TIME), transversally inserted in the peripheral nerve, has been shown to be useful for the selective activation of subsets of axons, both at inter- and intra-fascicular levels, in the small sciatic nerve of the rat. In this study we assessed the capabilities of TIME for the selective recording of neural activity, considering the topographical selectivity and the distinction of neural signals corresponding to different sensory types. Topographical recording selectivity was proved by the differential recording of CNAPs from different subsets of nerve fibers, such as those innervating toes 2 and 4 of the hindpaw of the rat. Neural signals elicited by sensory stimuli applied to the rat paw were successfully recorded. Signal processing allowed distinguishing three different types of sensory stimuli such as tactile, proprioceptive and nociceptive ones with high performance. These findings further support the suitability of TIMEs for neuroprosthetic applications, by exploiting the transversal topographical structure of the peripheral nerves.},

abstract = {One of the major problems when dealing with highly dexterous, active hand prostheses is their control by the patient wearing them. With the advances in mechatronics, building prosthetic hands with multiple active degrees of freedom is realisable, but actively controlling the position and especially the exerted force of each finger cannot yet be done naturally. This paper deals with advanced robotic hand control via surface electromyography. Building upon recent results, we show that machine learning, together with a simple downsampling algorithm, can be effectively used to control online, in real time, finger position as well as finger force of a highly dexterous robotic hand. The system determines the type of grasp a human subject is willing to use, and the required amount of force involved, with a high degree of accuracy. This represents a remarkable improvement with respect to the stateoftheart of feedforward control of dexterous mechanical hands, and opens up a scenario in which amputees will be able to control hand prostheses in a much finer way than it has so far been possible.},

abstract = {The vestibular organs are very important to generate reflexes critical for stabilizing gaze and body posture. Vestibular diseases significantly reduce the quality of life of people who are affected by them. Some research groups have recently started developing vestibular neuroprostheses to mitigate these symptoms. However, many scientific and technological issues need to be addressed to optimise their use in clinical trials. We developed a computational model able to mimic the response of human vestibular nerves and which can be exploited for 'in-silico' testing of new strategies to design implantable vestibular prostheses. First, a digital model of the vestibular system was reconstructed from anatomical data. Monopolar stimulation was delivered at different positions and distances from ampullary nerves. The electrical potential induced by the injected current was computed through finite-element methods and drove extra-cellular stimulation of fibers in the vestibular, facial, and cochlear nerves. The electrical activity of vestibular nerves and the resulting eye movements elicited by different stimulation protocols were investigated. A set of electrode configurations was analyzed in terms of selectivity at increasing injected current. Electrode position along the nerve plays a major role in producing undesired activity in other non-targeted nerves, whereas distance from the fiber does not significantly affect selectivity. Indications are provided to minimize misalignment in non-optimal electrode locations. Eye movements elicited by the different stimulation protocols are calculated and compared to experimental values, for the purpose of model validation.},

abstract = {An accurate and computationally efficient quantitative analysis of electromyography (EMG) signals plays an inevitable role in the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders, prosthesis, and several related applications. Since it is often the case that the measured signals are the mixtures of electric potentials that emanate from surrounding muscles (sources), many EMG signal processing approaches rely on linear source separation techniques such as the independent component analysis (ICA). Nevertheless, naive implementations of ICA algorithms do not comply with the task of extracting the underlying sources from a single-channel EMG measurement. In this respect, the present work focuses on a classification method for neuromuscular disorders that deals with the data recorded using a singlechannel EMG sensor. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm decomposes the single-channel EMG signal into a set of noise-canceled intrinsic mode functions, which in turn are separated by the FastICA algorithm. A reduced set of five time domain features extracted from the separated components are classified using the linear discriminant analysis, and the classification results are fine-tuned with a majority voting scheme. The performance of the proposed method has been validated with a clinical EMG database, which reports a higher classification accuracy (98{\%}). The outcome of this study encourages possible extension of this approach to real settings to assist the clinicians in making correct diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders.},

abstract = {? 2001-2012 IEEE.This paper is a review of multi-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) electrode used in the research for investigating the properties of muscles. Over 300 papers from five recognized journals were examined from the year 2000 to 2013 with only 64 stating the use of multi-channel electrodes in their research. The review determined that multi-channel electrodes can be classified as linear array or 2D array electrodes. The 2D array is the basis for developing the high-spatial-resolution sEMG (HSR-sEMG) or high density sEMG (HD-sEMG). The important factors considered in this review of the electrodes are: 1) the material used; 2) the inter-electrode distance; and 3) the configuration for the collection of the electromyography signals. The basic configurations of the sEMG electrodes are monopolar, bipolar, and double differential. It was found that the majority of the linear array electrodes were used to collect either bipolar or double differential signals. The 2D array electrodes were used to collect monopolar signals. The HSR-sEMG electrodes used a normal double differentiating filter, referred to as Laplacian configuration. The HD-sEMG has versatility being able to collect all types of signals, such as monopolar, bipolar, double differential, or signals filtered by Laplacian configuration.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study of motor unit behavior has been classically performed by selective recording systems of muscle electrical activity (EMG signals) and decomposition algorithms able to discriminate between individual motor unit action potentials from multi-unit signals. In this study, we provide a general framework for the decomposition of multi-channel intramuscular and surface EMG signals and we extensively validate this approach with experimental recordings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: First, we describe the conditions under which the assumptions of the convolutive blind separation model are satisfied. Second, we propose an approach of convolutive sphering of the observations followed by an iterative extraction of the sources. This approach is then validated using intramuscular signals recorded by novel multi-channel thin-film electrodes on the Abductor Digiti Minimi of the hand and Tibilias Anterior muscles, as well as on high-density surface EMG signals recorded by electrode grids on the First Dorsal Interosseous muscle. The validation was based on the comparison with the gold standard of manual decomposition (for intramuscular recordings) and on the two-source method (for comparison of intramuscular and surface EMG recordings) for the three human muscles and contraction forces of up to 90{\%} MVC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: The average number of common sources identified for the validation was 14 ± 7 (averaged across all trials and subjects and all comparisons), with a rate of agreement in their discharge timings of 92.8 ± 3.2{\%}. The average Decomposability Index, calculated on the automatic decomposed signals, was 16.0 ± 2.2 (7.3-44.1). For comparison, the same index calculated on the manual decomposed signals was 15.0 ± 3.0 (6.3-76.6).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: These results show that the method provides a solid framework for the decomposition of multi-channel invasive and non-invasive EMG signals that allows the study of the behavior of a large number of concurrently active motor units.},

abstract = {Background: Surface Electromyography (SEMG) signal has used in monitoring muscle activities. It has been widely applied in many areas, such as body member prosthesis, noise cancellation for brain-computer interface, and robotics. The SEMG acquisition method for collecting the signal with low-noise has extensively investigated in the last decade. The objective of this study is to review the recent works on electrode position and identify avenues for future research. Methods: A review of the relevant literature published between 1986 and 2015. This study commences with the basics of SEMG and recent methods for electrode position. Result: The different noises affecting SEMG signal include the spread of the innervation zone, cross-talk from neighbour muscles, electrode size, and location of electrode placement. Moreover, electrode placement or displacement effect SEMG signal in both time and frequency domain. Conclusion: Although several SEMG studies examined the effects of electrode position and internal electrode distance on forearm muscles, only a few studies addressed the methodological difficulties of the electrode position. In the majority of studies, electrodes were placed without the specific symptoms of the points along the length or shape of the muscle. Moreover, IED varied in different studies.},

abstract = {Surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals represent a superposition of the motor unit action potentials that can be recorded by electrodes placed on the skin. Here we explore the use of an easy wearable sEMG bracelet for a remote interaction with a computer by means of hand gestures. We propose a human-computer interface that allows simulating " mouse " clicks by separate gestures and provides proportional control with two degrees of freedom for flexible movement of a cursor on a computer screen. We use an artificial neural network (ANN) for processing sEMG signals and gesture recognition both for mouse clicks and gradual cursor movements. At the beginning the ANN goes through an optimized supervised learning using either rigid or fuzzy class separation. In both cases the learning is fast enough and requires neither special measurement devices nor specific knowledge from the end-user. Thus, the approach enables building of low-budget user-friendly sEMG solutions. The interface was tested on twelve healthy subjects. All of them were able to control the cursor and simulate mouse clicks. The collected data show that at the beginning users may have difficulties that are reduced with the experience and the cursor movement by hand gestures becomes smoother, similar to manipulations by a computer mouse.},

@article{Ghaderi2016,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to reconstruct low-quality High-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) signals, recorded with 2-d electrode arrays, using image inpainting and surface reconstruction methods. Methods: It is common that some fraction of the electrodes may provide low-quality signals. We used variety of image inpainting methods, based on partial differential equations (PDEs), and surface reconstruction methods, to reconstruct the time-averaged or instantaneous muscle activity maps of those outlier channels. Two novel reconstruction algorithms were also proposed. HDsEMG signals were recorded from the biceps femoris and brachial biceps muscles during low-to-moderate-level isometric contractions, and some of the channels (5 to 25 percent) were randomly marked as outliers. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the original and reconstructed maps was then calculated. Results: Overall, the proposed Poisson and wave PDE outperformed the other methods (average RMSE 8.7 $\mu$Vrms±6.1 $\mu$Vrms and 7.5 $\mu$Vrms±5.9 $\mu$Vrms) for the time-averaged single-differential and monopolar map reconstruction, respectively. Bi-harmonic Spline, the Discrete Cosine Transform and the Poisson PDE outperformed the other methods for the instantaneous map reconstruction. The running time of the proposed Poisson and wave PDE methods, implemented using a Vectorization package, was 4.6±5.7 ms and 0.6±0.5 ms respectively for each signal epoch or time sample in each channel. Conclusion: The proposed reconstruction algorithms could be promising new tools for reconstructing muscle activity maps in real-time applications. Significance: Proper reconstruction methods could recover the information of low-quality recorded channels in HDsEMG signals.},

abstract = {Gesture recognition in non-intrusive muscle-computer interfaces is usually based  on windowed descriptive and discriminatory surface electromyography (sEMG) features because the recorded amplitude of a myoelectric signal may rapidly fluctuate between voltages above and below zero. Here, we present that the patterns inside the instantaneous values of high-density sEMG enables gesture recognition to be performed merely with sEMG signals at a specific instant. We introduce the concept of an sEMG image spatially composed from high-density sEMG and verify our findings from a computational perspective with experiments on gesture recognition based on sEMG images with a classification scheme of a deep convolutional network. Without any windowed features, the resultant recognition accuracy of an 8-gesture within-subject test reached 89.3{\%} on a single frame of sEMG image and reached 99.0{\%} using simple majority voting over 40 frames with a 1,000 Hz sampling rate. Experiments on the recognition of 52 gestures of NinaPro database and 27 gestures of CSL-HDEMG database also validated that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts methods. Our findings are a starting point for the development of more fluid and natural muscle-computer interfaces with very little observational latency. For example, active prostheses and exoskeletons based on high-density electrodes could be controlled with instantaneous responses.},

abstract = {Surface EMG is an important tool in biomechanics, kinesiology and neurophysiology. In neurophysiology the concept of high-density EMG (HD-EMG), using two dimensional electrode grids, was developed for the measurement of spatiotemporal activation patterns of the underlying muscle and its motor units (MU). The aim of this paper was to determine, with the aid of a HD-EMG grid, the relative importance of a number of electrode sensor configurations for optimizing muscle force estimation. Sensor configurations are distinguished in two categories. The first category concerns dimensions: the size of a single electrode and the inter electrode distance (IED). The second category concerns the sensor's spatial distribution: the total area from which signals are obtained (collection surface) and the number of electrodes per cm 2 (collection density). Eleven subjects performed isometric arm extensions at three elbow angles and three contraction levels. Surface-EMG from the triceps brachii muscle and the external force at the wrist were measured. Compared to a single conventional bipolar electrode pair, the force estimation quality improved by about 30{\%} when using HD-EMG. Among the sensor configurations, the collection surface alone appeared to be responsible for the major part of the EMG based force estimation quality by improving it with 25{\%}. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {—This study presents a progressive FastICA peel-off (PFP) framework for high-density surface electromyogram (EMG) decomposition. The novel framework is based on a shift-in-variant model for describing surface EMG. The decomposition process can be viewed as progressively expanding the set of motor unit spike trains, which is primarily based on FastICA. To over-come the local convergence of FastICA, a peel-off strategy, i.e., removal of the estimated motor unit action potential trains from the previous step, is used to mitigate the effects of the already identified motor units, so more motor units can be extracted. A constrained FastICA is applied to assess the extracted spike trains and correct possible erroneous or missed spikes. These procedures work together to improve decomposition performance. The proposed framework was validated using simulated surface EMG signals with different motor unit numbers (30, 70, 91) and SNRs (20, 10, and 0 dB). The results demonstrated relatively large numbers of extracted motor units and high accuracies (high F1-scores). The framework was tested with 111 trials of 64-channel electrode array experimental surface EMG signals during the first dorsal interosseous muscle contraction at different intensities. On average motor units were identified from each trial of experimental surface EMG signals.},

abstract = {Aim: In recent years, physically challenged people faces more constraint in day to-day movements. In this work, an EMG based hands-free control system for a wheelchair is proposed. Methods: Trapezium EMG signals are acquired, analyzed and then processed into a controlled movements (forward, left, right, etc.) using an embedded circuits for the wheelchair. Results: The system allows the patient to choose a smooth independent movement in the control state or non-control state. The movements depend upon the strength of the EMG signals acquired. Conclusion: The entire system consists of EMG electrodes, a microcontroller and a DC motor for the operation of the wheelchair. The control system is incorporated with muscle processing circuits which give an independent and safe movement to the paraplegic patients.},

The following paper proposes a methodology using an ensemble learning technique coupled with the fast orthogonal search (FOS) algorithm to reliably predict varying isometric contractions of the right arm. This method leverages the rapid and precise modelling offered by FOS combined with a univariate outlier detection algorithm to dynamically combine the output of numerous FOS models. This is performed using high-density surface electromyography (HD-SEMG) obtained from three upper-arm muscles, the biceps brachii, triceps brachii and brachioradialis. This method offers improved performance over other HD-SEMG and SEMG based force estimators, with a substantial reduction in the number of channels required.},

abstract = {Compared to the traditional 2D path following case, 3D path following is more complicated since the coupling effect between horizontal and vertical plane has to be taken into account. In this paper, a sliding mode prediction controller is presented, which drives an underactuated AUV to follow a desired 3D path under time-varying current disturbances. A sliding mode technique combined with the predictive control strategy is developed to compensate for the impact of the hydrodynamic damping coupling via the feedback correction and receding horizon optimization techniques. In addition, Different from the traditional reference orientation method for path following control, here a methodology named 3D virtual guidance orientation (VGO) is built to deal with the vehicle dynamics. The geometric characteristic of tracking curve is contained in the control design as an extra degree of freedom to drive the vehicle to track a virtual target along desired path. Hence, the proposed method can avoid saturation problem of driving devices (stern plane and rudder) of AUV. Numerical simulations illustrate the excellent path following performance of the AUV in 3D under the proposed control scheme.},

During a test session at the university, motor empathy (facial electromyography), and self-reported affective and cognitive state empathy were assessed in response to empathy-inducing film clips portraying happiness and sadness. Adolescents who responded with stronger motor empathy consistently reported higher affective state empathy. Adolescents' motor empathy was also positively related to cognitive state empathy, either directly or indirectly via affective state empathy. Whereas trait empathy was consistently, but modestly, related to state empathy with sadness, for state empathy with happiness few trait–state associations were found. Together, the findings provide support for the notion that empathy is a multi-faceted phenomenon. Motor, affective and cognitive empathy seem to be related processes, each playing a diff...},

Nevertheless, other methods with computational advantages can be proposed; among them, a modified version of the beamforming algorithm is presented and compared with the ML estimator. In real cases, the resolution in delay estimation in the time domain is limited because of the sampling process. Transformation to the frequency domain allows a continuous estimation. A fast, high-resolution implementation of the presented multichannel techniques in the frequency domain is proposed. This approach is affected by a negligible decrease in performance with respect to ideal interpolation. Application of the ML estimator, based on two-channel information, to ten firings of each of three MUs provides a CV estimate affected by a standard deviation of 0.5 ms(-1); the modified beamforming and ML estimators based on five channels provide a CV standard deviation of less than 0.1 ms(-1) and allow the detection of statistically significant differences between the CVs of the three MUs. CV can therefore be used for MU classification.},

However, noisy EMG signals are the major hurdles to be overcome in order to achieve improved performance in the above applications. Detection, processing and classification analysis in electromyography (EMG) is very desirable because it allows a more standardized and precise evaluation of the neurophysiological, rehabitational and assistive technological findings. This paper reviews two prominent areas; first: the pre-processing method for eliminating possible artifacts via appropriate preparation at the time of recording EMG signals, and second: a brief explanation of the different methods for processing and classifying EMG signals. This study then compares the numerous methods of analyzing EMG signals, in terms of their performance. The crux of this paper is to review the most recent developments and research studies related to the issues mentioned above.},
