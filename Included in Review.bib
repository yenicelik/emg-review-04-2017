abstract = {? 2001-2012 IEEE.This paper is a review of multi-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) electrode used in the research for investigating the properties of muscles. Over 300 papers from five recognized journals were examined from the year 2000 to 2013 with only 64 stating the use of multi-channel electrodes in their research. The review determined that multi-channel electrodes can be classified as linear array or 2D array electrodes. The 2D array is the basis for developing the high-spatial-resolution sEMG (HSR-sEMG) or high density sEMG (HD-sEMG). The important factors considered in this review of the electrodes are: 1) the material used; 2) the inter-electrode distance; and 3) the configuration for the collection of the electromyography signals. The basic configurations of the sEMG electrodes are monopolar, bipolar, and double differential. It was found that the majority of the linear array electrodes were used to collect either bipolar or double differential signals. The 2D array electrodes were used to collect monopolar signals. The HSR-sEMG electrodes used a normal double differentiating filter, referred to as Laplacian configuration. The HD-sEMG has versatility being able to collect all types of signals, such as monopolar, bipolar, double differential, or signals filtered by Laplacian configuration.},

abstract = {Recent work in muscle sensing has demonstrated the poten-tial of human-computer interfaces based on finger gestures sensed from electrodes on the upper forearm. While this approach holds much potential, previous work has given little attention to sensing finger gestures in the context of three important real-world requirements: sensing hardware suitable for mobile and off-desktop environments, elec-trodes that can be put on quickly without adhesives or gel, and gesture recognition techniques that require no new training or calibration after re-donning a muscle-sensing armband. In this note, we describe our approach to over-coming these challenges, and we demonstrate average clas-sification accuracies as high as 86{\%} for pinching with one of three fingers in a two-session, eight-person experiment.},

@article{Martinez-Valdes2016,
abstract = {Objective: To assess the intra- and inter-session reliability of estimates of motor unit behavior and muscle fiber properties derived from high-density surface electromyography (HDEMG). Methods: Ten healthy subjects performed submaximal isometric knee extensions during three recording sessions (separate days) at 10{\%}, 30{\%}, 50{\%} and 70{\%} of their maximum voluntary effort. The discharge timings of motor units of the vastus lateralis and medialis muscles were automatically identified from HDEMG by a decomposition algorithm. We characterized the number of detected motor units, their discharge rates, the coefficient of variation of their inter-spike intervals (CoVisi), the action potential conduction velocity and peak-to-peak amplitude. Reliability was assessed for each motor unit characteristics by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Additionally, a pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) was calculated, to verify the accuracy of the decomposition. Results: Good to excellent reliability within and between sessions was found for all motor unit characteristics at all force levels (ICCs {\textgreater} 0.8), with the exception of CoVisi that presented poor reliability (ICC {\textless} 0.6). PNR was high and similar for both muscles with values ranging between 45.1 and 47.6 dB (accuracy {\textgreater} 95{\%}). Conclusion: Motor unit features can be assessed non-invasively and reliably within and across sessions over a wide range of force levels. Significance: These results suggest that it is possible to characterize motor units in longitudinal intervention studies.},

@article{McIntosh2016,
abstract = {Practical wearable gesture tracking requires that sensors align with existing ergonomic device forms. We show that combining EMG and pressure data sensed only at the wrist can support accurate classification of hand gestures. A pilot study with unintended EMG electrode pressure variability led to exploration of the approach in greater depth. The EMPress technique senses both finger movements and rotations around the wrist and forearm, covering a wide range of gestures, with an overall 10-fold cross validation classification accuracy of 96{\%}. We show that EMG is especially suited to sensing finger movements, that pressure is suited to sensing wrist and forearm rotations, and their combination is significantly more accurate for a range of gestures than either technique alone. The technique is well suited to existing wearable device forms such as smart watches that are already mounted on the wrist.},

abstract = {The aim of this mini-review is to describe the potential application of surface electromyography (sEMG) techniques in aging studies. Aging is characterized by multiple changes of the musculoskeletal system physiology and function. This paper will examine some of the innovative methods used to monitor age-related alterations of the neuromuscular system from sEMG signals. A description of critical assumptions which underlie some of these approaches is emphasized. The first part focuses on the evolution of the recording techniques and describes some methodological issues. The second part focuses on how to use the following techniques to characterize aging: amplitude and spectral sEMG signal analysis, muscle fiber conduction velocity estimation, and myoelectric fatigue assessment. The last part describes a number of advanced sEMG approaches which seem promising in the geriatric population to estimate motor unit number, size, recruitment thresholds, and firing rates. {\textcopyright} 2014 S.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been major interest in the exposure to physical therapy during rehabilitation. Several publications have demonstrated its usefulness in clinical/medical and human machine interface (HMI) applications. An automated system will guide the user to perform the training during rehabilitation independently. Advances in engineering have extended electromyography (EMG) beyond the traditional diagnostic applications to also include applications in diverse areas such as movement analysis. This paper gives an overview of the numerous methods available to recognize motion patterns of EMG signals for both isotonic and isometric contractions. Various signal analysis methods are compared by illustrating their applicability in real-time settings. This paper will be of interest to researchers who would like to select the most appropriate methodology in classifying motion patterns, especially during different types of contractions. For feature extraction, the probability density function (PDF) of EMG signals will be the main interest of this study. Following that, a brief explanation of the different methods for pre-processing, feature extraction and classifying EMG signals will be compared in terms of their performance. The crux of this paper is to review the most recent developments and research studies related to the issues mentioned above.},

abstract = {Gesture recognition in non-intrusive muscle-computer interfaces is usually based  on windowed descriptive and discriminatory surface electromyography (sEMG) features because the recorded amplitude of a myoelectric signal may rapidly fluctuate between voltages above and below zero. Here, we present that the patterns inside the instantaneous values of high-density sEMG enables gesture recognition to be performed merely with sEMG signals at a specific instant. We introduce the concept of an sEMG image spatially composed from high-density sEMG and verify our findings from a computational perspective with experiments on gesture recognition based on sEMG images with a classification scheme of a deep convolutional network. Without any windowed features, the resultant recognition accuracy of an 8-gesture within-subject test reached 89.3{\%} on a single frame of sEMG image and reached 99.0{\%} using simple majority voting over 40 frames with a 1,000 Hz sampling rate. Experiments on the recognition of 52 gestures of NinaPro database and 27 gestures of CSL-HDEMG database also validated that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts methods. Our findings are a starting point for the development of more fluid and natural muscle-computer interfaces with very little observational latency. For example, active prostheses and exoskeletons based on high-density electrodes could be controlled with instantaneous responses.},

abstract = {Background: Surface Electromyography (SEMG) signal has used in monitoring muscle activities. It has been widely applied in many areas, such as body member prosthesis, noise cancellation for brain-computer interface, and robotics. The SEMG acquisition method for collecting the signal with low-noise has extensively investigated in the last decade. The objective of this study is to review the recent works on electrode position and identify avenues for future research. Methods: A review of the relevant literature published between 1986 and 2015. This study commences with the basics of SEMG and recent methods for electrode position. Result: The different noises affecting SEMG signal include the spread of the innervation zone, cross-talk from neighbour muscles, electrode size, and location of electrode placement. Moreover, electrode placement or displacement effect SEMG signal in both time and frequency domain. Conclusion: Although several SEMG studies examined the effects of electrode position and internal electrode distance on forearm muscles, only a few studies addressed the methodological difficulties of the electrode position. In the majority of studies, electrodes were placed without the specific symptoms of the points along the length or shape of the muscle. Moreover, IED varied in different studies.},

abstract = {Compared to the traditional 2D path following case, 3D path following is more complicated since the coupling effect between horizontal and vertical plane has to be taken into account. In this paper, a sliding mode prediction controller is presented, which drives an underactuated AUV to follow a desired 3D path under time-varying current disturbances. A sliding mode technique combined with the predictive control strategy is developed to compensate for the impact of the hydrodynamic damping coupling via the feedback correction and receding horizon optimization techniques. In addition, Different from the traditional reference orientation method for path following control, here a methodology named 3D virtual guidance orientation (VGO) is built to deal with the vehicle dynamics. The geometric characteristic of tracking curve is contained in the control design as an extra degree of freedom to drive the vehicle to track a virtual target along desired path. Hence, the proposed method can avoid saturation problem of driving devices (stern plane and rudder) of AUV. Numerical simulations illustrate the excellent path following performance of the AUV in 3D under the proposed control scheme.},
